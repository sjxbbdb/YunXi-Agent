# Extraction Status

## Current Stage

The repository currently contains:

- A standalone Rust workspace
- `yunxi-agent-core` facade types
- A dry-run `Agent` runner
- A minimal `yunxi-agent-cli`
- A `yunxi-agent-codex` integration crate for upstream Codex headless runtime
- YunXi-owned runtime boundary crates:
  - `yunxi-agent-runtime`
  - `yunxi-agent-provider`
  - `yunxi-agent-tools`
  - `yunxi-agent-storage`
- A vendored Codex Rust workspace snapshot at `vendor/codex-rs`
- A `CodexSource` boundary retained for source-shape checks and future refresh
  tooling

## Stage 4A Runtime Boundary

Stage 4A introduces a YunXi-owned autonomous runtime boundary.

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-runtime` owns the first YunXi runtime backend implementation.
- `yunxi-agent-provider` owns provider request/response interfaces and a
  deterministic `StaticProvider`.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` owns tool request/response interfaces and a placeholder
  `NoopToolRuntime`.
- `yunxi-agent-storage` owns session records and an in-memory session store.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` defaults to `--backend yunxi`.
- `--backend dry-run`, `--backend codex`, and `--live` remain available for
  smoke checks and compatibility.

The `yunxi` backend emits YunXi `AgentEvent` values directly and does not depend
on `vendor/codex-rs`. The Codex backend remains as an explicit compatibility
path while provider/tool/storage behavior is migrated in later slices.

## Next Stage

Stage 4C should turn the independent default runtime into a practical
YunXi-owned agent by adding a real provider adapter, approval/sandbox policy,
constrained patch support, and session CLI commands. The development report is
recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-10-yunxi-stage-4c-provider-policy-runtime-report.md`.

## Stage 4C Provider, Policy, Patch, And Session Slice

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-provider` owns OpenAI-compatible provider configuration,
  request serialization, response parsing, auth source resolution, and
  fixture-backed completion.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` owns explicit approval and sandbox policy mapping from
  `AgentConfig` before tool execution.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` owns constrained patch operations for write and delete,
  with rejection of absolute paths and parent-directory traversal.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` maps provider-requested shell, patch, MCP, and skill
  calls into policy-carrying YunXi tool requests.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` emits provider turn reasoning, tool completion,
  warning, patch, command, MCP, and file-change events through YunXi event
  types.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` can list and inspect file-backed sessions through
  `sessions list` and `sessions show`.

- disabled-vendor verification: pass after temporarily renaming
  `vendor/codex-rs` to `vendor/codex-rs.disabled`
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only

## Stage 4D Planned Direction

The next stage is Codex core agent parity extraction. Its goal is to replicate
the Codex CLI headless Agent core capabilities in YunXi-owned crates while
keeping the default YunXi runtime independent from `vendor/codex-rs` and
`codex-*` crates.

The Stage 4D development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-10-yunxi-stage-4d-codex-core-agent-parity-report.md`.

Stage 4D implementation has started with the first parity foundation slice:

- `docs/extraction-index/codex-core-agent-parity-map.md` maps Codex core agent
  source files to YunXi-owned target crates.
- `yunxi-agent-protocol` owns provider/runtime input, response, tool-call, and
  JSONL event protocol types.
- `yunxi-agent-context` owns the first AGENTS.md hierarchy loader and context
  bundle facade.
- `yunxi-agent-sandbox` owns approval, sandbox, cwd, and network policy
  decision types.
- `yunxi-agent-exec` owns command canonicalization and output aggregation
  primitives.
- `yunxi-agent-patch` owns constrained JSON patch and Codex-style
  `*** Begin Patch` application.
- `yunxi-agent-mcp` owns MCP configuration, resource, and tool invocation
  interfaces.
- `yunxi-agent-skills` owns skill discovery, metadata, and invocation
  interfaces.
- `yunxi-agent-multi-agent` owns multi-agent command and registry interfaces.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` now loads workspace `AGENTS.md` instructions into the
  provider message stream.
- `yunxi-agent-cli parity map` prints the Codex core parity migration map.

Stage 4D full parity is not complete yet. The current slice establishes the
autonomous YunXi-owned module boundaries needed to continue mechanical
migration from `vendor/codex-rs` without adding upstream crate dependencies.

- disabled-vendor verification: pass after temporarily renaming
  `vendor/codex-rs` to `vendor/codex-rs.disabled`
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only

## Stage 4B Full Autonomy Slice

Implemented in this slice:

- The default workspace member set excludes `yunxi-agent-codex`.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` no longer depends on `yunxi-agent-codex`.
- `--backend codex` and `--live` report clear compatibility guidance in
  default builds.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` owns a shell command executor.
- `yunxi-agent-provider` can represent provider-requested tool calls.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` can execute provider-requested shell tools and feed
  results back into the provider loop.
- `yunxi-agent-storage` owns file-backed session records under
  `.yunxi/sessions`.

## Vendored Codex Source

Stage 3 imported the Codex Rust workspace source into `vendor/codex-rs` on
2026-07-10.

- Upstream commit at import time: `f1affbac5e5164b2bae825e9b39e9868bc4e0be2`
- Import style: mechanical full Rust workspace source snapshot
- Excluded during import: `target`, `.git`, `node_modules`
- Local patch record: `vendor/codex-rs/patches/README.md`

`yunxi-agent-codex` path dependencies now point at `vendor/codex-rs`, so the
native backend source is intended to be available from a fresh YunXi checkout
without manually creating `external/codex-rs`.

Stage 3 verification has now been run against the vendored source. The native
backend no longer depends on a developer-created `external/codex-rs` link for
Cargo path resolution.

## Local Codex Source Link

`external/codex-rs` may still exist in a developer workspace as a junction or
symlink to a local Codex CLI checkout. It is no longer the source of truth for
normal YunXi builds.

The `CodexSource` boundary verifies the checkout shape by checking for:

- `codex-rs/Cargo.toml`
- `codex-rs/exec/src/lib.rs`
- `codex-rs/app-server-client/Cargo.toml`

The controller confirmed these three files exist in the real local checkout
used for this extraction, but that local path is intentionally not recorded
here.

## Stage 2 Live Backend

The Codex native backend has a source-level new-thread runner behind the
`codex-native` feature. Normal tests do not require live credentials.

Current live scope:

- text prompt
- new headless thread
- ephemeral run
- cwd/model/provider mapping
- approval and sandbox mapping
- in-process Codex app-server runtime
- JSONL event mapping into YunXi events

The in-process runtime is the upstream Codex Agent stack, so shell execution,
patches, AGENTS.md loading, MCP configuration, skills runtime, session storage,
and rollout behavior stay inside the embedded Codex runtime rather than being
reimplemented in YunXi core.

Still expanding:

- resume/history CLI flags
- full MCP fixture coverage
- skills fixture coverage
- Windows helper/arg0 packaging verification for patch and sandbox helpers
- owned extraction of selected upstream runner internals after the source-level
  bridge is stable

## Stage 2 Verification

Verified on 2026-07-09:

- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-codex --features codex-native`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-cli --features codex-native`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --features codex-native`: pass
- gated live smoke without `YUNXI_RUN_LIVE_CODEX_TESTS=1`: pass and skipped

Live credential smoke was not run; it remains gated by
`YUNXI_RUN_LIVE_CODEX_TESTS=1`.

## Stage 3 Verification

- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-codex --features codex-native`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-cli --features codex-native`: pass

  pass and skipped without `YUNXI_RUN_LIVE_CODEX_TESTS=1`
- `git diff --check`: pass

During the first native check, the `v8` crate failed while decompressing the
downloaded `rusty_v8` prebuilt library. The failed build-script output and
temporary `rusty_v8` target files were removed, and the same native check passed
on the next run. No source change was needed for that transient artifact issue.

Live credential smoke was not run; it remains gated by
`YUNXI_RUN_LIVE_CODEX_TESTS=1`.
